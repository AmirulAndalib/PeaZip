To use additional translations, download the desired language file and copy it in (peazip)res/share/lang folder. 
PeaZip is usually installed in C:\Program Files\PeaZip on Windows, or /usr/lib/peazip on *x systems. 
If the language file is compressed, extract and copy in the aforementioned path the .txt file.

To change PeaZip's language, use main menu Options > Localization.

PeaZip comes with multiple language files, but since additional translations are made available asynchronously from third parts contributors, latest available translation for each language is featured here for separate download. 
Each x.y subfolder contains language file for a specific release, minor releases x.y.z shares the same text.

NOTE FOR TRANSLATORS: 
instructions about how to provide a translated language files is provided in in readme_about_translations.txt file of peazip-x.y.z.about_translations.zip package, available for download from https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip-Translations/releases/tag/x.y.z release subfolder.
