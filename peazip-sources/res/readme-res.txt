(peazip)/res/portable is an empty file to set the application to wiork as portable application, saving configuration to (peazip)/res/conf path rather than in user path (which also depends on the target operating system's standards)

(peazip)/res/bin directory contains architecture specific third party binaries (and on Windows PeaZip configuration wizard), see an existing package for reference

(peazip)/res/conf directory contains configuration files for portable packages, otherwise conf path is user specific

(peazip)/res/share directory contains non-architecture specific files: sample batch files, licenses, icons and graphics, language files
