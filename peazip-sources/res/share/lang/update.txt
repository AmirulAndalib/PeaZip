Hi, I'm the author of PeaZip, I've noticed CNET download directory lists a very old release of my software 7.4.2 (which was released over two years ago), while the new release is 8.8.0 is now available.

I would like to kindly ask you to update the listing of the software:

https://download.cnet.com/PeaZip-Portable-32-bit/3000-2250_4-76414845.html

All information and downloads of the up to date version are now available on PeaZip's project page on GitHub https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip

Please don't hesitate to contact me on my email giorgio.tani.software@gmail.com for any question regarding my software.
